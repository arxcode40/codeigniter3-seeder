# CodeIgniter 3 Database Seeding

Database seeding is a simple way to add data into your database. It is especially useful during development where you need to populate the database with sample data that you can develop against, but it is not limited to that. Seeders can contain static data that you donâ€™t want to include in a migration, like countries, or geo-coding tables, event or setting information, and more.
